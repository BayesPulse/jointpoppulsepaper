Source code from "Modeling associations between latent event processes governing time series of pulsing hormones"

The repo contains the code for the spatial birth death process for the two hormone population model with a Cox cluster process as a model of the pulse locations and the single hormone population model implemented in the comparisons of this paper.

Work is ongoing to improve this code and add to our growing R package.  See the pulatile repro in this BayesPulse organization.
